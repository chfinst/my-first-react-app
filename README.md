# My Counter
1. Import the Header Component into ``<App />`` and pass it a proper title prop.
2. Import ``<Counter />``
3. Replace the text "NA" with the current counter state ({} is used to wrap javascript variables inside Jsx).
4. Make two functions: increment and decrement. Use the onClick property on the button tags to call the functions when the buttons are clicked.
5. Make ``<Counter />`` take initial state as a prop. Use this prop to set the initial state.
6. Pass the properties minCount and maxCount to ``<Counter />`` and prevent the user from choosing an illegal state. This can be done by setting the disabled property to true on the buttons.
7. Make a button that, when clicked, resets the counter state.
8. Use your imagination to implement some new awesome features.
